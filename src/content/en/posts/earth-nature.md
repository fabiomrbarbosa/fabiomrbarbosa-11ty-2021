And if the Song of the World places us on the same level as all other beings, capable of building up or damaging their surroundings and of living the consequences in their respective worlds, what are the boundaries of this "Nature" we talk about?

One of the foundations of earth spirituality consists of developing an increasingly just relationship with the earth that serves us as our home. But, as I wrote on another occasion, I think that this practice also invites us to make ourselves a Home, both for those around us and for our very own individuality.

In other words, a just relationship depends on the fundamental values of hospitality and reciprocity. We give because we receive constantly and in different ways. We learn to receive what is due to us so that we may give even more.

This essential care of the magician who is also a gardener is above all the most basic inclination of all beings. We exist in harmony, to the rhythm of the *Oran Mór* - which is as deadly as it is life-giving, it must be said —, as long as we do not unlearn it. There are so many factors that lead us to this forgetfulness: the integration into a disenchanted and disenchanted society; all the economic and productive structures that see the Earth and its people, either human or animal, as mere inexhaustible resources; the concrete and systematic discriminations that attack our sense of safety and personal worth; the very doubts about the meaning of the Great Song.

What if we trusted? What if it actually made sense to us to embrace the archetype of the magician and gardener who care for the soul as well as the world around us? Then we would understand the struggles of those whose voice was drowned by the noise of some other players taking part in the Song of the World. We would have more urgency in preserving our soils, our waters, our air, our thoughts and emotions, the wills and dreams that we polluted at the funeral of our childhoods. We would have more attention to our body, that eternal neglected to whom we owe everything, from the small pleasures to the biggest vanities. We would finally fulfil the goal of solidarity, for the same Nature where the voices of myths are heard speaks to us through the diverse, rich and inviolable bodies of all creatures.

As for the Earth, it will proceed on its path, capable of regulating all imbalances and cleansing itself of any parasites, as it has always done. It is up to us here and now, at the intersection of our privileges and oppressions, with more or less idyllic visits to stone circles and dense forests, to choose whether to in fact enter the compass, the everyday dance, or to remain on the fringe of life itself.

*"First of all, be a good animal."*

— Ralph Waldo Emerson
