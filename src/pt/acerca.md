I am a third-culture kid, an islander born in the Azores, now living as a digital nomad. After dropping out of Journalism and Media Studies, I started my career as a podcaster and radio broadcaster. Five years later, I moved on to mainland Portugal, and thus to the world of marketing and advertising, where I had the chance to work as a freelance web developer, copy and scriptwriter, designer and English—Portuguese translator.

In my work, I've come to develop the necessary expertise to deliver turn-key creative solutions for television and digital media. Nowadays, I intend to focus on sustainable, higher awareness projects that target structural change.

In my spare time, I am an amateur researcher and author in the fields of mythology and spirituality, interested in the intersection of the Perennial Wisdom and the many earth-based and mystery traditions. I have published several articles in like-minded media, in which I expound on our urgent need for a non-dualistic and empathic way of living.

Besides that, I am also a poet, a fountain pen nerd and a budding polyglot, currently working my way through German tongue-twisters and Japanese kanji.
